The reason for this is that where new\n                  text is displayed, it is intended to be visible to all users.

However,\n                  not all changes to content involve the addition of text to the screen.

For example, the proximity of new\n                     content to other pieces of information on the screen may provide a visual context\n                     that is lacking in the text alone.\n                  </p>\n                  \t\t\n                  <p>In such cases, authors may wish to designate additional content for inclusion in the\n                     status message, including non-displayed text which can be provided to the assistive\n                     technologies, for added context.

An example would be a shopping cart which updates text from\n                     reading &quot;0 items&quot; to &quot;3 items&quot;. Typical methods of writing such changes in the page\n                     content result in the entire modified text string being considered a new change, and\n                     thus read by assistive technologies. However, where only the number in this string\n                     was coded as an updated chunk of content, the resulting experience for screen reader\n                     users could be to only hear &quot;three&quot;, which may not be sufficient information to provide\n                     context for the user.

The most obvious example of this is where a message\n                     is displayed that the system is &quot;busy&quot; or &quot;waiting&quot;. For a sighted user, when this\n                     text disappears, it is normally an indication that the state is now available.

Where updating the visible message (e.g.,\n                     to &quot;system available&quot;) is not feasible, the use of a non-visible status message, such\n                     as &quot;system available&quot;, ensures equivalent status information is provided.
